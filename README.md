# WiFinder
WiFinder is a Node.js web app that lists nearby places with wifi where people can go and get some work done. It displays the facilities, opening and closing times, average rating, and a location map for each place. Anyone can log in and submit a new location with wifi, or submit a new review for a location.

It's pretty cool
